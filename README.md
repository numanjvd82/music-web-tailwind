# MyTunes 

## Website created with Tailwind CSS and React
This was a practice project on a YouTube channel called [Do Some Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADgtJoo3cF8&ab_channel=DoSomeCoding "Do Some Coding"). He created it with only HTML and CSS. I wanted to turn things up a notch. So, I created it with Tailwind CSS and React.
